    "For people living in cities across the world, air pollution is a serious environmental concern. It has been connected to a number of health issues, including as cancer, cardiovascular and respiratory disorders, and early mortality. Everyone is impacted by air pollution, but certain neighborhoods and populations are disproportionately affected. Thus, figuring out practical ways to lessen the negative impacts of air pollution requires an understanding of the various regions' air quality and how it changes over time."

One of the world's most populous cities is New York City, and its citizens are quite concerned about air pollution. Information on a number of air pollutants, such as particulate matter, ozone, nitrogen dioxide, sulfur dioxide, and carbon monoxide, is provided by this dataset. An extensive examination of the trends and patterns in the city's air quality is made possible by the dataset, which spans several years and places."

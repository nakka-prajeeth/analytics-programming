        "In the high-stakes arena of financial markets, quarterly financial reports are pivotal events for investors and analysts alike, serving as a barometer for a company's financial health and future prospects. These reports, which provide a snapshot of a company's performance, including revenue, earnings, expenses, and profit margins, have the potential to trigger significant movements in stock prices. This is especially true in the technology sector, where companies are subjected to intense scrutiny given their rapid growth trajectories and the disruptive nature of the industry.\n",
        "\n",
        "The anticipation leading up to the release of these reports often fuels volatility as market participants speculate on the results. Post-release, the actual figures can lead to swift revaluation of stocks. For technology companies, where innovation and growth are the benchmarks for success, these financial reports can be even more impactful, as they reflect the company's ability to capitalize on market opportunities and manage operational challenges.\n",
        "\n",
        "The dissemination of financial results is also a matter of timing and strategy. Companies choose to release their reports before the market opens or after it closes, which can have varied effects on investor reaction and stock price movements. Moreover, the degree to which the reported figures deviate from analysts' expectations—referred to as 'earnings surprises'—can exacerbate or mitigate the market reaction.\n",
        "\n",
        "Understanding the relationship between these reports and subsequent stock price movements is not only crucial for investors looking to maximize returns or hedge risks but also for the companies themselves as they strategize on the timing and content of their financial disclosures. The proposed study aims to dissect and analyze the multifaceted impact of quarterly financial reports on the stock prices of technology firms, providing insights that could enhance investment strategies and corporate financial communication practices."

        "Our investigation seeks to unravel the complex relationship between quarterly financial disclosures and stock price movements. To this end, we pose the following research questions:\n",

        "1.  Primary Question: How do quarterly financial reports impact the stock prices of technology companies?\n",
        "\n",
        "    We aim to quantify the immediate and longer-term effects of financial disclosures on stock prices. This question will drive our investigation into specific metrics that can influence investor sentiment and market behavior.\n",
        "\n",
        "2.  Secondary Questions:\n",
        "\n",
        "    -   Financial Metrics Correlation: Which specific financial metrics within the reports (such as earnings per share, revenue growth, operational costs, etc.) have the most significant correlation with stock price movements?\n",
        "\n",
        "        By focusing on individual financial metrics, we can identify which aspects of the report are most closely watched by the market and potentially carry the most weight in investment decisions.\n",
        "\n",
        "    -   Timing of Report Releases: Does the timing of the report release (before market open, after market close) have a discernible impact on stock price volatility?\n",
        "\n",
        "        This question explores the strategic aspect of the timing of financial disclosures and whether it plays a role in how the information is digested by the market.\n",
        "\n",
        "    -   Earnings Surprises: How do stock prices react to varying degrees of earnings surprises, both positive and negative?\n",
        "\n",
        "        Earnings surprises often lead to the most dramatic stock price movements. We will examine whether the magnitude and direction of the surprise have proportional effects on stock performance.\n",
        "\n",
        "The outcomes of these inquiries could have profound implications for investors and corporate finance strategies. A deeper understanding of these dynamics could lead to more informed investment decisions and improved timing and approach to financial communications for technology firms."

        "\n",
        "    -   Key financial metrics will be extracted from the quarterly reports, including but not limited to earnings per share, net revenue, operational costs, and profit margins.\n",

        "    -   Method of collection: We will develop a web scraping tool using Python's BeautifulSoup or Scrapy to extract the relevant financial figures from the reports as they are published.\n",

        "By integrating these datasets, we will be able to correlate specific financial report metrics with stock price fluctuations. The data will be cleaned, normalized, and stored in a structured format suitable for analysis. All datasets will be hosted on a public GitHub repository to ensure reproducibility and accessibility of the data and analysis process."
